# dresser.io
This is the official github repo for dresser.io

â€ƒThis tool is a simple concept app prototype to help you in picking your outfits. There are six essential pages to look out for:
â€¢ Homepage - displays all the cloths you have not committed[explained later]. You can then click on these cloths to either delete, edit or commit them
â€¢ New cloth - you concrete new cloths here
â€¢ Generate - you can't generate outfits(combinations) here
â€¢ History - shows a log of all your activities
â€¢ Profile - shows the very little info we have on you along with your combinations and stats
â€¢ About - speaks for itself
â€ƒâ€ƒâ€ƒFurthermore, to utilize the app, there are four terms you need to know - 'cloths', 'committing', 'combos', 'blackliting & using'
â€¢ Cloths - these are cloths that are created by you they can either be a top(shirt) or a bottom(pant). When you create a new cloth, you can decide to commit it or not
â€¢ Committing - any 'uncommitted' cloth would not be available when you generate a new combo. You can commit or uncommit a cloth any number of times
â€¢ Combos - a combo is basically a generated outfit. When you go to the 'generate' page and generates an outfit, you can click generate to create a new one, blacklist or use a combo
â€¢ Blacklisting & Using - blacklisting a combo means you do not want to use but you also do not want it to be suggested(generated) anymore[maybe cuz it looks hideous] while using a combo means you have accepted that particular combo
